v2.0.0

Make sure you install `healthier@^2.0.0`. Healthier has been switched to use eslint formatted output and so this plugin has been updated based on the official eslint plugin. What this all means is:

- it should be faster, since healthier no longer double parses the files (first via eslint, second via prettier)
- syntax errors are handled correctly now and showed in the editor instead of being only logged
- eslint internal errors, such as information about missing plugins is handled correctly now and showed in the editor
